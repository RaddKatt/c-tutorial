/*
A pointer declaration is formatted like this:	<variable_type> *<pointer_name;>
For example:					int *pointer_to_the_integer;		

To declare a pointer, an asterisk * must immediately preceed the var name (ex: int *my_pointer)

Declaration of one pointer & one regular integer:
	int *my_pointer, non_pointer;

Declaration of two pointers:
	int *pointer1, *pointer2;
